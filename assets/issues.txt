1. When you move to the left/right at maximum speed and click the same arrow twice
then the speed doubles
    - I think that's because the event calls the requestAnimationFrame twice
2. When you move to the left/right at maximum speed and change the moving direction
you will get a glitch, which looks like sliding.
3. When you click jump key too times, the jump messes up.
